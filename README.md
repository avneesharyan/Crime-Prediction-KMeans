**Crime Prediction Using K-Means Algorithm**
**Overview**
This project aims to predict crime rates in different areas using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By analyzing historical crime data, we can identify patterns and group areas with similar crime characteristics. The K-Means algorithm is employed to cluster geographical regions based on crime rates, enabling law enforcement agencies and policymakers to allocate resources more effectively.

**Requirements**
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1.Python 3.x
2.Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
3.Required Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Install the necessary packages using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

**Usage**
**Data Preparation:**

Acquire historical crime data for the target area.
Clean and preprocess the data using the provided Jupyter Notebook (data_preparation.ipynb).
**Training the Model:**

Run the notebook crime_prediction.ipynb to train the K-Means clustering model on the prepared data.
Adjust parameters such as the number of clusters according to your requirements.
**Visualization:**

Explore the results and visualizations in the notebook to understand the clustered areas and crime patterns.
**Prediction**:

Utilize the trained model to predict crime clusters for new data or upcoming time periods.
**Files**
data_preparation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.
crime_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the K-Means algorithm implementation and visualizations.
crime_data.csv: Sample dataset for crime prediction.
**Results**
